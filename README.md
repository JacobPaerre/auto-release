# auto-release

Example code for auto-release with semantic versioning

## How does this work?
A workflow is run on every merge where changes are made to the src-folder on main. The workflow will take the latest release version tag and increment the patch number by default. This means, that if you merge 10 commits to main, only 1 version increment will happen. 

It is also possible to update the minor- and major-version by either writing `#minor` or `#major` in the commit message. This will then increment the major (and reset patch and minor) if that is asked for, or increment minor (and reset patch).

**Note:** A release will also be made and set to latest. \
The release will have the autogenerated changelog for releases and the tag defined above will be used.
